In Rails, forms usually have an associated model object. Models define validations which include validation messages that describe which validations failed and why. Primer forms automatically display validation messages when a model object is provided.

## Custom validation messages

All form inputs allow overriding the default validation message via the `:validation_message` argument:

<%= code :ruby do %>
  class ExampleForm < ApplicationForm
    form do |example_form|
      example_form.text_field(
        name: :foo,
        label: "Foo",
        validation_message: "Custom validation message"
      )
    end
  end
<% end %>

A custom validation message is also useful if no associated model object is available, i.e. for forms that are not tied to a database table.

## Input focus

Primer forms will automatically focus the first invalid input in accordance with accessibility best-practices. Inputs are considered invalid if the associated model's field is invalid _or_ if a custom validation message has been provided.
