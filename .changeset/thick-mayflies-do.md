[Primer::Beta::Autocomplete] Added a new component to render inside the the Autocomplete dropdown: Primer::Beta::AutoComplete::NoResultItem. This new component can be used to display a message to indicate that there are no available results. This component is marked upas role='presentation' as the autocomplete component already uses aria-live to announce if there are no results.
