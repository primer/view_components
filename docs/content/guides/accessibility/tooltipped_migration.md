title: Tooltipped migration
---

## Rule Details

The Primer CSS tooltip set via `.tooltipped` has been deprecated. There are major accessibility concerns with using this deprecated tooltip so please migrate away from `.tooltipped`.

Depending on your usecase, there are two migration paths you should consider.

### 1. Don't use tooltip at all

### 2. Migrate to the more accessible PVC tooltip

### Examples
